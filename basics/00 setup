first install setup file from https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html
execute 'rustup' in windwo cmdprompt  --> gives a list of commands that we can use
execute 'rustup toolchain list' --> to  look at the various toolchains that are installed by default. there are two (stable and maybe-buggy)
exec 'rustup update' to update to latest

 Rust is an ahead-of-time compile language. That means that you have to compile your source code first which then generates a binary 
 executable and then, is supposed to run the executable that's generated for you.
In order to run the file we just said, use "rustc hello_world.rs."
(an error appears saying : linker `link.exe` not found ---- extra has to be added; checkout windows section 
 https://github.com/rust-lang/rust 
 
 In http://www.msys2.org/ install second one which has x86_64 in its name
 
 seems like some mingw or whatever should also be added
 )
